                <h1>Bhagat Singh</h1>
                <p>Bhagat Singh was a charismatic Indian revolutionary who participated in the mistaken murder of a
                    junior British police officer in what was to be retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist.
                </p>
                <p>Bhagat Singh was an Indian revolutionary freedom fighter who was hanged to death by British
                    colonisers at the age of 23 years. Fondly known as 'Shaheed (martyr) Bhagat Singh', he is considered
                    a national hero of India's freedom struggle against colonial rule. As a teenager, Bhagat Singh
                    popularised the slogan of ‘Inquilab Zindabad’ which eventually became the catchphrase of the Indian
                    independence movement.
                </p>
                <h2>Bhagat Singh's Life</h2>
                <p>Bhagat Singh was born in a Sikh family in Banga village of Faisalabad district (previously called
                    Lyallpur), now in Pakistan's Punjab province, on 27 September 1907. As his family was deeply
                    inspired by nationalism, he too became actively involved in the country's freedom movements.

                    He quit education at the age of thirteen and got admitted to the National College in Lahore, where
                    he studied European revolutionary movements. When his parents tried to get him married, Bhagat Singh
                    left home for Kanpur. In 1926, Bhagat Singh established the 'Naujavan Bharat Sabha (Youth Society of
                    India) and joined the Hindustan Republican Association (later known as Hindustan Socialist
                    Republican Association). During that time, he met many anti-colonial activists.

                    In December 1928, Bhagat Singh, along with Sukhdev and Rajguru, planned to avenge the death of
                    Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai and plotted to assassinate the Superintendent of Police
                    James Scott in Lahore.

                    However, in a case of mistaken identity, John Saunders, the Assistant Superintendent of Police was
                    shot. To avoid being recognised and arrested for the crime, Bhagat Singh escaped from Lahore to
                    Calcutta after shaving his beard and cutting his hair.

                    In April 1929, Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt bombed the Central Assembly Hall in Delhi, and shouted the
                    slogan of “Inquilab Zindabad!”. He was later arrested after the incident.</p>
                <h2>Execution of Bhagat Singh</h2>
                <p>Bhagat Singh and his revolutionary comrades Rajguru and Sukhdev were hanged by the British on March
                    23, 1931, in the Lahore Conspiracy case.</p>
                    <p>In 1928, the British government set up the Simon Commission to report on the political situation in India. Some Indian political parties boycotted the Commission because there were no Indians in its membership,[c] and there were protests across the country. When the Commission visited Lahore on 30 October 1928, Lala Lajpat Rai led a march in protest against it. Police attempts to disperse the large crowd resulted in violence. The superintendent of police, James A. Scott, ordered the police to lathi charge (use batons against) the protesters and personally assaulted Rai, who was injured. Rai died of a heart attack on 17 November 1928. Doctors thought that his death might have been hastened by the injuries he had received. When the matter was raised in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the British Government denied any role in Rai's death.[31][32][33]

                        Singh was a prominent member of the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) and was probably responsible, in large part, for its change of name to Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) in 1928.[34] The HSRA vowed to avenge Rai's death.[24] Singh conspired with revolutionaries like Shivaram Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar, and Chandrashekhar Azad to kill Scott.[27] However, in a case of mistaken identity, the plotters shot John P. Saunders, an Assistant Superintendent of Police, as he was leaving the District Police Headquarters in Lahore on 17 December 1928.[35]
                        HSRA pamphlet after Saunders' murder, signed by Balraj, a pseudonym of Chandrashekhar Azad
                        
                        Contemporary reaction to the killing differs substantially from the adulation that later surfaced. The Naujawan Bharat Sabha, which had organised the Lahore protest march along with the HSRA, found that attendance at its subsequent public meetings dropped sharply. Politicians, activists, and newspapers, including The People, which Rai had founded in 1925, stressed that non-co-operation was preferable to violence.[30] The murder was condemned as a retrograde action by Mahatma Gandhi, the Congress leader, but Jawaharlal Nehru later wrote that:
                        
                            Bhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism but because he seemed to vindicate, for the moment, the honour of Lala Lajpat Rai, and through him of the nation. He became a symbol, the act was forgotten, the symbol remained, and within a few months each town and village of the Punjab, and to a lesser extent in the rest of northern India, resounded with his name. Innumerable songs grew about him and the popularity that the man achieved was something amazing.</p>
